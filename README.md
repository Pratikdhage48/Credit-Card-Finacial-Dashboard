To deliver an intuitive, interactive dashboard that:

Provides a 360° view of credit card revenue and interest generation

Breaks down transaction usage patterns by card type, channel, and expenditure

Segments customers by age, job, education, income, and more

Helps business users identify high-value customer groups and optimize targeting strategies
